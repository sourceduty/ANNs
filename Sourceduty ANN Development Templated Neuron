1. Input Metrics

- Each neuron receives numerical input features, e.g., age, height, weight.

Examples:

Age, Height, Weight, Temperature, Blood pressure, Heart rate, Cholesterol, Glucose, Purchases, Income, Education, Distance, Duration, Rating, Probability.

Image inputs: color intensity, color, brightness.

2. Input Metric Values

- Metric values adjust the weighted sum of inputs.

Values:

Positive: Increases input influence.
Negative: Decreases input influence.
Zero: Ignores input.
Small: Slightly influences output.
Large: Strongly influences output.
Adjustable: Learned during training.

Examples:

0.0: red, 0.1: yellow, 0.2: green, ..., 1.0: brown

3. Custom Biased Activation

- Transforms metric values to output using a bias.
- Example function: output = input + bias.
- Custom Biased Activation Equation: f(x)=∣x+1∣ Custom Biased Activation introduces non-linearity. 

Example Calculations:

A1: 0.5 + 0.2 bias = 0.7
B1: 0.8 + 0.2 bias = 1.0
C1: 0.6 + 0.2 bias = 0.8

4. Output Metrics

- Calculate outputs based on input and activation.

Example Outputs:

Image color intensity: 0.7
Image color: 1.0
Image color brightness: 0.8

Sourceduty ANN Development Templated Neuron outlines a structured approach for building neural networks by breaking down the process into four main components: input metrics, metric values, custom biased activation, and output metrics. The input metrics are the numerical features that feed into each neuron, such as age, height, temperature, or more complex attributes like image color intensity. These inputs are processed using metric values, which are weighted sums that adjust the influence of each input feature. Values can be positive, negative, or zero, indicating their role in enhancing, reducing, or ignoring an input's effect. The valuess are fine-tuned during training to optimize the model's performance.

The custom biased activation function is a crucial part of this template, introducing non-linearity into the neural network. This function takes the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias value to produce an output, allowing the network to learn complex patterns. For instance, a simple linear function like adding a constant bias can transform inputs and alter the direction of outputs, making the relationship between input and output more intricate. Finally, the output metrics provide the final processed values, which are influenced by the preceding input metrics, metric values, and activation functions. This structured approach ensures clarity in how each part of the network operates and interacts, facilitating the design and understanding of neural network behavior.
